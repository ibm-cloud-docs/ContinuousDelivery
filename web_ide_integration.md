# Adding the Eclipse Orion Web IDE
{: #webide}

The Eclipse Orion {{site.data.keyword.webide}} feature in the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}} service is deprecated. The {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service does not provide a direct replacement. As of 8 August 2022, new toolchains will not include the {{site.data.keyword.webide}} as a default tool. You cannot create and add instances of the {{site.data.keyword.webide}} tool integration to existing toolchains. Existing instances of the {{site.data.keyword.webide}} continue to operate normally. As of 7 October 2022, the {{site.data.keyword.webide}} tool integration will be removed from existing toolchains and the associated data will be deleted. It is recommended that you export your data from your {{site.data.keyword.webide}} workspace before this date, or commit and push all of your outstanding changes into a Git repository.
{: deprecated}

The Eclipse Orion {{site.data.keyword.webide}} is an integrated web-based environment where you can create, edit, run, debug, and complete source control tasks. You can seamlessly move from editing to running to submitting to deploying.

 This tool integration is preconfigured. It does not require any configuration parameters and you cannot reconfigure it.

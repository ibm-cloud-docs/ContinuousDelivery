# Using toolchains
{: #toolchains-using}

Open toolchains are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}. You can use a toolchain to be productive in your daily development, deployment, and operations work. After you set up a toolchain, you can add, delete, or configure tool integrations and manage access to the toolchain.
{: shortdesc}

Cloud Foundry org-based {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service instances and toolchains are deprecated. You can no longer create Cloud Foundry org-based {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service instances. As of 14 January 2022, you cannot create new toolchains within Cloud Foundry orgs. You can create new toolchains in resource groups. On 28 February 2022, all toolchains within Cloud Foundry orgs that did not contain a Professional plan instance of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service were deleted. As of 15 August 2022, all toolchains within Cloud Foundry orgs that contain a Professional plan instance of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service will be deleted. Before this date, you can use the [toolchain migration wizard](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-migrate_toolchains) to migrate existing toolchains from Cloud Foundry orgs to resource groups.
{: deprecated}

You can manage toolchains in the Dallas, Washington, Toronto, Sao Paulo, London, Frankfurt, Sydney, Osaka, and Tokyo Public regions by using resource groups. You can use Cloud Foundry organizations (orgs) to manage toolchains in the Dallas, London, and Frankfurt Public regions. Access control and authorized user management function differently for toolchains depending on whether they are contained in a resource group or a Cloud Foundry org.

## Configuring a tool integration
{: #configuring_a_tool_integration}

If you deferred the configuration of a tool integration when you created a toolchain, a **Configure** button is shown on its card. If you configured a tool integration when you created a toolchain, you can update the configuration settings.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**. 
1. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on the App details page in your app, click the toolchain name.
1. If you need to configure a tool integration for the first time, on its card, click **Configure**.

   ![Configure button](images/toolchain_tile_configure.png){: caption="Figure 1. Configure tool integration" caption-side="bottom"}

   When you are finished configuring the tool integration, click **Save Integration**.

1. If you need to update a tool integration's configuration, on its card, click the menu to access the configuration options.

   ![Configuration menu](images/toolchain_tile_menu.png){: caption="Figure 2. Update tool integration" caption-side="bottom"}

   A few of the tool integrations are preconfigured and don't require any configuration parameters. You can update the configuration settings for only the tool integrations that you configured.
   {: tip}

   When you are finished updating the settings, click **Save Integration**. For more information about configuring specific tool integrations, see [Configuring tool integrations](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-integrations).

## Adding a tool integration
{: #adding_a_tool_integration}

You can add and configure tool integrations for your toolchain.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**.
1. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on the App details page in your app, click the toolchain name.
1. To see a list of tool integrations to add, click **Add tool**.
1. Click a tool integration that you want to add.
1. Enter any required information to configure the tool integration.
1. Click **Create Integration** to add the tool integration to your toolchain.

## Deleting a tool integration
{: #deleting_a_tool_integration}

If you delete a tool integration from your toolchain, the deletion cannot be undone.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**. 
1. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on the App details page in your app, click the toolchain name.
1. On the card for the tool integration that you want to delete, click the menu to access the configuration options.
1. To delete the tool integration from your toolchain, click **Delete**.
1. Confirm by clicking **Delete**.  

## Viewing toolchain connections to apps, clusters, and services
{: #view_toolchain_connections}

You can view your toolchain's connections to Cloud Foundry apps, Kubernetes clusters, and services.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**. 
1. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on the App details page in your app, click the toolchain name.
1. Select the **Connections** tab, and select the app, cluster, or service that you want to view.

## Managing access to toolchains
{: #managing_access_resource_groups}

You can use the Identity and Access Management (IAM) service to manage user access to toolchains in resource groups. For more information about managing access control with IAM, see [Managing user access to toolchains in resource groups](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains-iam-security).

You can also grant users access to toolchains by adding them to both the Cloud Foundry org that the toolchain is associated with and the access control list for the toolchain. For more information about granting users access to toolchains in Cloud Foundry orgs, see [Managing user access to toolchains in Cloud Foundry orgs](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains-cf-security).

Users with access to toolchains might be counted as authorized users of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}} service. For more information about how authorized users are counted, see [Plan limitations and usage](/docs/services/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-limitations_usage).

## Organizing toolchains
{: #organizing_toolchains}

You can add tags to your toolchains to organize them and easily find them later. A tag is a label that you assign to a toolchain for easy filtering of toolchains in your toolchains list.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**. 
1. On the Toolchains page, locate the toolchain that you want to add a tag to and click **Add tags**.
1. Enter a name for the tag that you want to add to the toolchain. You can add multiple tags, which are separated by commas.
1. Click **Save**.

For more information about tags, see [Working with tags](/docs/account?topic=account-tag).


## Deleting a toolchain
{: #deleting_a_toolchain}

You can delete a toolchain. When you delete a toolchain, the deletion cannot be undone.

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**. 
1. On the Toolchains page, click a toolchain to open its Overview page. Alternatively, on the App details page in your app, click the toolchain name.
1. Click the **Actions** menu and select **Delete**. Deleting a toolchain removes all of its tool integrations, which might delete resources that are managed by those integrations.
1. Confirm the deletion by typing the name of the toolchain and clicking **Delete**.  

   When you delete a GitHub or {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}} tool integration, the associated repo is not deleted from GitHub or {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}}. You must manually remove the repo.

# Toolchain availability, templates, and tutorials  
{: #cd_about}
{: support}

Toolchains are available on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public. You can use a template or Terraform as a starting point to create a toolchain.
{: shortdesc}

## Toolchain templates
{: #templates}

You can use a template as a starting point to [create a toolchain](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/create){: external}. Toolchain templates include specific sets of tool integrations that support development, deployment, and operations tasks.

Some toolchain templates include tool integrations that are part of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service. If an instance of that service isn't already in your resource group, when you click **Create** to create the toolchain, the service is automatically added with the selected free Lite plan. For more information and terms, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/continuous-delivery/){: external}.

The predefined DevOps toolchain templates are recommended examples that solve real world scenarios and each contains a sample app. You can use your own app by specifying your Git repo when you create the toolchain from the template.

## Toolchain Terraform
{: #code_toolchains_terraform}

You can use Terraform to define, create, and manage toolchains by using an *as code* approach.

You can start with an {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Terraform Provider example, such as [ibm-cd-toolchain-simple-helm](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/tree/master/examples/ibm-cd-toolchain-simple-helm){: external} or [ibm-cd-tekton-pipeline](https://github.com/IBM-Cloud/terraform-provider-ibm/tree/master/examples/ibm-cd-tekton-pipeline){: external}, or you can write your own Terraform.

To start working with Terraform, see [Setting up Terraform for {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-terraform-setup). For more information about the Terraform resources and data sources for {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} including the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service, see the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Provider Documentation](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/IBM-Cloud/ibm/latest/docs){: external}.

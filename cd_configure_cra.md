# Configuring Code Risk Analyzer
{: #cd-configure-cra-repos}


Code Risk Analyzer takes all of your Git-based code, configurations, and deployment artifacts, builds a dependency graph, and runs a pipeline of regulatory compliance control checks. It is embedded into existing development workflows, such as creating a change request or promoting a code change into the main development branch. It produces a bill of materials that reflects the composition of a deployment. And it identifies specific versions of packages and Linux&reg; operating systems distributions that contain published vulnerabilities.
{: shortdesc}

Code Risk Analyzer supports the Java&trade;, Node.js, and Python languages. The following table lists and describes the content that Code Risk Analyzer supports.

|Content |Description	|
|:----------|:------------------------------|
|Java		|The repo must use Maven. Dependencies are calculated by using the `pom.xml` file.		|
|Node.js		|Dependencies are calculated by using the `package-lock.json` file.		|
|Python		|Dependencies are calculated by using the `requirements.txt` file.		|
|Golang		|Supports `go mod` and `go dep` dependency management. For `go mod`, the `go.sum` file must be in the repo. For `go dep`, the `Gopkg.lock` file must be in the repo.		|
| Dockerfiles		|Files with the `Dockerfile` pattern in the repo are considered. For container images, the Debian, Alpine, and Ubutu Linux distros are supported.  		|
| Kubernetes		|Files that are suffixed with `.yaml` and `.yml` are considered. The `kind` value must be set to `Pod`, `ReplicaSet`, `ReplicationController`, `Deployment`, `Daemonset`, `Statefulset`, `Job`, or `CronJob`.   		|
|Terraform		|The repo must use Terraform v0.13.5 and IBM Cloud as a Terraform provider for compliance checks.		|
{: caption="Table 1. Supported content" caption-side="top"}

Code Risk Analyzer supports only github.com repos, and {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}} repos that are hosted by {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}.

## Known issues with Code Risk Analyzer
{: #cra_known_issues}

Code Risk Analyzer has the following current known issues:

* Semantic versioning is supported only for package versioning (major.minor.patch). Code Risk Analyzer does not currently support package versions that contain pre-release versions or build metadata.
* If too many vulnerabilities are found, the Pull Request comment might display only a subset of the vulnerabilities.
* Tekton tasks might appear all green even when minor errors exist.

## Enabling Code Risk Analyzer to scan pull requests and merge requests
{: #cra_enable_requests}

You must use a Tekton pipeline to run Code Risk Analyzer tasks on your code repo. When you are running other Continuous Integration or {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} flows, you can use either Classic pipelines or Tekton pipelines to run Code Risk Analyzer on your code repo.
{: tip}

Complete the following steps to enable Code Risk Analyzer to scan pull requests and merge requests on your code repositories (repos):

1. Use the Build your own toolchain template to create an empty toolchain that you can add the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration to.
1. Add the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration to the toolchain.
1. Add the code repo that contains the code you want to scan to the toolchain. For example, add a GitHub or GitLab repo, or the tekton-catalog repo to the toolchain.
1. Create an API key to authenticate with Code Risk Analyzer.
1. Create and configure a Tekton pipeline.

Code Risk Analyzer is currently available for toolchains only in the Dallas region.

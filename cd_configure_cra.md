# Configuring Code Risk Analyzer
{: #cd-configure-cra-repos}


Code Risk Analyzer takes all of your Git-based code, configurations, and deployment artifacts, builds a dependency graph, and runs a pipeline of regulatory compliance control checks. It is embedded into existing development workflows, such as creating a change request or promoting a code change into the main development branch. It produces a bill of materials that reflects the composition of a deployment. And it identifies specific versions of packages and Linux&reg; operating systems distributions that contain published vulnerabilities.
{: shortdesc}

These Code Risk Analyzer Tekton pipeline tasks and definitions are deprecated. As of 1 October, 2021, you must use the new Tekton pipeline tasks and definitions that are provided in the [Code Risk Analyzer plug-in](/docs/code-risk-analyzer-cli-plugin).
{: deprecated}

## Supported content
{: #cra_supported_content}

Code Risk Analyzer supports the Java&trade;, Node.js, and Python languages. The following table lists and describes the content that Code Risk Analyzer supports.

|Content |Description	|
|:----------|:------------------------------|
|Java		|The repo must use Maven. Dependencies are calculated by using the `pom.xml` file.		|
|Node.js		|Dependencies are calculated by using the `package-lock.json` file.		|
|Python		|Dependencies are calculated by using the `requirements.txt` file.		|
|Golang		|Supports `go mod` and `go dep` dependency management. For `go mod`, the `go.sum` file must be in the repo. For `go dep`, the `Gopkg.lock` file must be in the repo.		|
| Dockerfiles		|Files with the `Dockerfile` pattern in the repo are considered. For container images, the Debian, Red Hat Enterprise Linux, Alpine, and Ubutu Linux distros are supported.  		|
| Kubernetes		|Files that are suffixed with `.yaml` and `.yml` are considered. The `kind` value must be set to `Pod`, `ReplicaSet`, `ReplicationController`, `Deployment`, `Daemonset`, `Statefulset`, `Job`, or `CronJob`.   		|
|Terraform		|The repo must use Terraform v0.13.5 and IBM Cloud as a Terraform provider for compliance checks.		|

## Known issues with Code Risk Analyzer
{: #cra_known_issues}

Code Risk Analyzer has the following current known issues:

* Semantic versioning is supported only for package versioning (major.minor.patch). Code Risk Analyzer does not currently support package versions that contain pre-release versions or build metadata.
* If too many vulnerabilities are found, the Pull Request comment might display only a subset of the vulnerabilities.
* Tekton tasks might appear all green even when minor errors exist.

## Enabling Code Risk Analyzer to scan pull requests and merge requests
{: #cra_enable_requests}

You must use a Tekton pipeline to run Code Risk Analyzer tasks on your code repo. When you are running other Continuous Integration or {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} flows, you can use either Classic pipelines or Tekton pipelines to run Code Risk Analyzer on your code repo.
{: tip}

Complete the following steps to enable Code Risk Analyzer to scan pull requests and merge requests on your code repositories (repos):

1. Use the Build your own toolchain template to create an empty toolchain that you can add the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration to.
1. Add the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration to the toolchain.
1. Add the code repo that contains the code you want to scan to the toolchain. For example, add a GitHub or GitLab repo, or the tekton-catalog repo to the toolchain.
1. Create an API key to authenticate with Code Risk Analyzer.
1. Create and configure a Tekton pipeline.

Code Risk Analyzer is available for toolchains in all regions.

## Configuring Code Risk Analyzer to build package manifest files
{: #cra_build_package_manifests}

The Code Risk Analyzer Discovery task automatically searches for the package manifest files that are listed in the table within the [Supported content](#cra_supported_content) section. If a package manifest file is not found in the repo, you can configure the Discovery task to automatically build the package manifest file for the supported languages.

The following table lists and describes each of the supported environment properties.

| Environment property | Description |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| nodejs-create-package-lock | A Boolean (`true` or `false`) value that indicates whether to create the `package-lock.json` file.  This environment property requires the repo to contain a `package.json` file. |
| python-create-requirements-txt | A Boolean (`true` or `false`) value that indicates whether to create  the `requirements.txt` file.  This feature supports both Python 2 and Python 3. |
{: caption="Table 2. Environment properties" caption-side="top"}

## Configuring Code Risk Analyzer to ignore files
{: #cra_ignore_files}

The Code Risk Analyzer Discovery and CIS tasks search for the `.cra/.fileignore` file path in the repo that is cloned and scanned. The `.fileignore` file must follow the rules of [`.gitignore` files](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore){: external}. Similar to a `.gitignore` file, the `.fileignore` file can include comments, directories to ignore, files to ignore, and other [patterns](https://git-scm.com/docs/gitignore#_pattern_format){: external}.

The following example `.fileignore` file shows how to exclude bash scripts, node_modules, and the Dockerfile.

```
# Ignore nested functional_tests directory
**/functional_tests

# Ignore bash scripts
**/*.sh

# This should allow this one file
!test/gatling_tests/loginTobx.sh

# Ignore node_modules
node_modules

# Exclude the dockerfile from scanning
Dockerfile
```

`.craignore` is deprecated for the `.fileignore` file.
{: tip}

## Configuring Code Risk Analyzer to omit vulnerabilities
{: #cra_omit_vulnerabilities}

The Code Risk Analyzer Vulnerability task searches for the `.cra/.cveignore` file path in the repo that is cloned and scanned. This file is used to specify the CVEs to either omit indefinitely, until a remediation is available, or until a specified expiration date.

The following example shows a JSON schema for the `.cveignore` file.

```json
[
    {
        "cve": "string",
	"alwaysOmit": "bool",
	"untilRemediationAvailable": "bool",
	"expiration": "string"
    }
]
```

The following properties are accepted for each entry in the `.cveignore` file:

* **cve** - The vulnerability to omit. The value of this property is either a CVE ID or a Snyk ID.
* **alwaysOmit** - If this property is set to true, the vulnerability is omitted until it is changed. This property takes precedence over other property values.
* **untilRemediationAvailable** - If this property is set to true, the vulnerability is omitted  until a remediation path is available. If a remediation becomes available, the vulnerability is not omitted and a message is displayed. This property takes precedence over the expiration property  value.
* **expiration** - If this property is set to true and the expiration date is not reached, the vulnerability is omitted. If the expiration date is reached, the vulnerability is not omitted and a message is displayed. 
 
The Code Risk Analyzer uses only these defined properties. You can add properties with no effect on functions. If a vulnerability that is defined in the `.cveignore` is not omitted, a log is generated that explains the reason. If a vulnerability that is defined in the `.cveignore` file is omitted, no individual logging is displayed. The number of omissions and a list of the vulnerability IDs, with the package name, that are omitted are logged after a report is completed.

The following code snippet shows a sample `.cveignore` file.

```json
[
    {
        "cve": "CVE-2021-27290",
        "alwaysOmit": true
    },
    {
        "cve": "CVE-2020-8244",
        "untilRemediationAvailable": true,
    },
    {
        "cve": "SNYK-JAVA-ORGAPACHEHTTPCOMPONENTS-31517",
        "expiration": "2022-02-10T22:08:41+04:00",
        "comment": "Additional security measures are in place"
    }
]
```

`.cracveomit` is deprecated and replaced by `.cveignore`.
{:  tip}

## Configuring Code Risk Analyzer to exclude dev dependencies
{: #cra_exclude_dev_dependencies}

The Code Risk Analyzer Vulnerability task uses the `exclude-dev` Boolean (`true` or `false`) property to exclude dev dependencies from the Vulnerability report. By default, this value is set to `false`. When this value is set to `true`, it excludes any vulnerabilities from dev dependencies in the Vulnerability report. Extra configuration is required in the Code Risk Analyzer Discovery task to exclude dev dependencies for Maven and Gradle based projects from Vulnerability reports.

For Maven based projects, the Code Risk Analyzer Discovery task requires you to set the `maven-exclude-scopes` property to specify which scopes to exclude dependencies for from the Vulnerability Report. You can specify multiple scopes by setting this property to a comma-separated string value.

For Gradle based projects, the Code Risk Analyzer Discovery task requires you to set the `gradle-exclude-configs` property to specify which Gradle configurations to exclude Java&trade; dependencies for from the Vulnerability Report. You can specify multiple configurations by setting this property to a comma-separated string value.

The following table lists and describes each of the supported environment properties.

| Environment property | Description |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| exclude-dev | A Boolean (`true` or `false`) value that indicates whether to exclude dev dependencies from Code Risk Analyzer Vulnerability scans. |
| maven-exclude-scopes | A String value, such as `test,compile`, that indicates the Maven scopes with corresponding dependencies that must be marked as `dev` during Code Risk Analyzer Discovery scanning. |
| gradle-exclude-configs | A String value, such as `runtimeClasspath,testCompileClasspath`, that indicates the Gradle configurations with corresponding dependencies that must be marked as `dev` during Code Risk Analyzer Discovery scanning. |
{: caption="Table 3. Exclude dev dependencies environment properties" caption-side="top"}

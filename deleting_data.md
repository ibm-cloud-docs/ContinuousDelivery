# Deleting your {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data
{: #deleting_data}

{{site.data.keyword.DRA_full}} hosts your data in a highly available and secure environment. Client and system credentials are stored on encrypted disks. Access to data is limited to only those users that require the data to support and maintain {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}. Data that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} is indexed by a toolchain ID. When you delete a toolchain, all of the data that is related to repos that was collected as part of the toolchain is deleted.
{: shortdesc}

You can delete data in the following ways:

- Delete build, test, and deploy records
- Delete {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data for a repo by disabling
- Delete integration between Toolchain and {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}
- Delete a repo from your toolchain

For more information about toolchains, see [Creating a toolchain from an app](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains_getting_started#creating_a_toolchain_from_an_app).

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} doesn't manage data in {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}. If you stop using {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}, you must delete your own data. To delete your data, delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration from your toolchain. If the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration is not added again to the toolchain within seven days, the data is deleted.
{: important}


## Deleting {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data sets
{: #deleting-data-sets}

With the Manage data dashboard, you can delete {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data for a toolchain, an environment, an application, or a branch. All {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data for builds, test results, and deployment records are deleted. This data includes predefined and custom data, but not repo data. 

Data canâ€™t be recovered after it is deleted.
{: tip}

To see your manage data dashboard, complete the following steps: 

1. From the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg) and select **DevOps**.

### Deleting toolchain data
{: #deleting-toolchain-data}

Toolchain data is all of the data that is associated with that toolchain. Deleting toolchain data doesn't delete the toolchain, or the tools that are associated with it. It deletes the data that is used by all of the tools that are attached to that toolchain.

1. To delete toolchain data, go to **Manage Data** > **Quality Data**.
2. Select **Toolchain data**. 
3. Click **Delete**.

## Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration
{: #insights-delete-integration}

To delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration, you must delete {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} from your toolchain. To delete {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} from your toolchain, complete the following steps to delete the tool integration by using the console, with the API, or with Terraform.

### Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration by using the console
{: #insights-delete-integration-ui}
{: ui}

1. Click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**.
2. On the Toolchains page, select your toolchain.
3. From your toolchain's Overview page, on the **IBM Cloud tools** card, click the Overflow icon ![ellipsis icon](images/overflow-icon-2.svg) on your {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} instance. Then, select **Delete**.

### Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration with the API
{: #insights-delete-integration-api}
{: api}

1. [Obtain an IAM bearer token](https://{DomainName}/apidocs/toolchain#authentication){: external}. Alternatively, if you are using an SDK, [obtain an IAM API key](https://{DomainName}/iam/apikeys){: external} and set the client options by using environment variables.
   
   ```bash
   export CD_TOOLCHAIN_AUTH_TYPE=iam
   export CD_TOOLCHAIN_APIKEY={iam_api_key}
   export CD_TOOLCHAIN_URL=https://api.{region}.devops.cloud.ibm.com/toolchain/v2/toolchains
   ```
   {: pre}

2. [Determine the region and ID of the toolchain](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains_getting_started&interface=api#viewing-toolchain-api).

3. Determine the ID of the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   ```curl
   curl -X GET \
     https://api.{region}.devops.cloud.ibm.com/toolchain/v2/toolchains/{toolchain_id}/tools \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
     -H "Accept: application/json"
   ```
   {: pre}
   {: curl}

   ```javascript
   const CdToolchainV2 = require('continuous-delivery-node-sdk/cd-toolchain/v2');
   ...
   const toolchainService = CdToolchainV2.newInstance();
   const draTool = await toolchainService.getToolById({
      toolchainId: toolchainId,
      toolId: toolId
   });
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: node}

   ```go
   import (
	   "github.com/IBM/continuous-delivery-go-sdk/cdtoolchainv2"
   )
   ...
   toolchainClientOptions := &cdtoolchainv2.CdToolchainV2Options{}
   toolchainClient, err := cdtoolchainv2.NewCdToolchainV2UsingExternalConfig(toolchainClientOptions)
   getToolByIDOptions := toolchainClient.NewGetToolByIDOptions(toolchainId, toolId)
   draTool, response, err := toolchainClient.GetToolByID(getToolByIDOptions)
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: go}

4. Delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration from the toolchain.

   ```curl
   curl -X DELETE \
     https://api.{region}.devops.cloud.ibm.com/toolchain/v2/toolchains/{toolchain_id}/tools/{tool_integration_id} \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}' \
     -H 'Accept: application/json`
   ```
   {: pre}
   {: curl}

   ```javascript
   const response = await toolchainService.deleteTool({
      toolchainId: toolchainId,
      toolId: draToolId
   });
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: node}

   ```go
   deleteToolOptions := toolchainClient.NewDeleteToolOptions(toolchainId, draToolId)
   response, err := toolchainClient.DeleteTool(deleteToolOptions)
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: go}

The following table lists and describes each of the variables that are used in the previous steps.   
    
| Variable | Description |
|:---------|:------------|
| `{iam_api_key}` | Your IAM API key. |
| `{region}` | The region in which the toolchain resides. For example, `us-south`. |
| `{tool_integration_id}` | The ID of the tool integration to delete. |
| `{toolchain_id}` | The ID of the toolchain in which to delete the tool integration. |
| `{token}` | A valid IAM bearer token. |

For more information about the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration, see [Adding DevOps Insights](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-dra).

### Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration with Terraform
{: #insights-delete-integration-terraform}
{: terraform}

1. Locate the Terraform file (for example, `main.tf`) that contains the `resource` block for the existing {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   The `resource` blocks in the following example describe an existing toolchain and {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   ```terraform
   data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
     name = "default"
   }

   resource "ibm_cd_toolchain" "cd_toolchain" {
     name              = "my toolchain"
     resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
   }

   resource "ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_devopsinsights" "cd_toolchain_tool_insights" {
     toolchain_id = ibm_cd_toolchain.cd_toolchain.id
   }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. Remove the `resource "ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_devopsinsights"` block from your Terraform file.

3. Initialize the Terraform CLI.

   ```terraform
   terraform init
   ```
   {: pre}
   
4. Create a Terraform execution plan. This plan summarizes all of the actions that must run to delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   ```terraform
   terraform plan
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Apply the Terraform execution plan. Terraform takes all of the required actions to delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   ```terraform
   terraform apply
   ```
   {: pre}

For more information about using Terraform with {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}, see [Setting up Terraform for {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-terraform-setup).

## Deleting a repo
{: #deleting-repo}

When you delete a repo, all of the data that is related to that repo is also deleted.

1. Click the menu icon ![hamburger icon](images/icon_hamburger.svg), and select **DevOps**.
2. On the Toolchains page, select your toolchain.
3. From your toolchain's Overview page, on the **Repositories** card, click the Overflow icon ![ellipsis icon](images/overflow-icon-2.svg) on the repo that you  want to delete. Then, select **Delete**.

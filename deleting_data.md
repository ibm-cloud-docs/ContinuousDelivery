# Deleting your {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data
{: #deleting_data}

{{site.data.keyword.DRA_full}} hosts your data in a highly available and secure environment. Client and system credentials are stored on encrypted disks. Access to data is limited to only those users that require the data to support and maintain {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}. Data that is stored in {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} is indexed by a toolchain ID. When you delete a toolchain, all of the data that is related to repos that was collected as part of the toolchain is deleted.
{: shortdesc}

You can delete data in the following ways:

- Delete build, test, and deploy records
- Delete {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} data for a repo by disabling
- Delete integration between Toolchain and {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}
- Delete a repo from your toolchain

For more information about toolchains, see [Creating a toolchain from an app](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-toolchains_getting_started#creating_a_toolchain_from_an_app).

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} doesn't manage data in {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}. If you stop using {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}}, you must delete your own data. To delete your data, delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration from your toolchain. If the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration is not added again to the toolchain within seven days, the data is deleted.

   const tools = await toolchainService.listTools({
      toolchainId: {toolchain_id},
   });
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: node}

   ```go
   import (
	   "github.com/IBM/continuous-delivery-go-sdk/cdtoolchainv2"
   )
   ...
   toolchainClientOptions := &cdtoolchainv2.CdToolchainV2Options{}
	toolchainClient, err := cdtoolchainv2.NewCdToolchainV2UsingExternalConfig(toolchainClientOptions)
	listToolsOptions := toolchainClient.NewListToolsOptions({toolchain_id})
	tools, response, err := toolchainClient.ListTools(listToolsOptions)
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: go}

   ```python
   from ibm_continuous_delivery.cd_toolchain_v2 import CdToolchainV2
   ...
   toolchain_service = CdToolchainV2.new_instance()
   tools = toolchain_service.list_tools(
      toolchain_id = {toolchain_id}
   )
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: python}

   ```java
   import com.ibm.cloud.continuous_delivery.cd_toolchain.v2.CdToolchain;
   import com.ibm.cloud.continuous_delivery.cd_toolchain.v2.model.*;
   ...
   CdToolchain toolchainService = CdToolchain.newInstance();
   ListToolsOptions listToolsOptions = new ListToolsOptions.Builder()
      .toolchainId({toolchain_id})
      .build();
   Response<ToolchainToolCollection> response = toolchainService.listTools(listToolsOptions).execute();
   ToolchainToolCollection tools = response.getResult();
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: java}

4. Delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration from the toolchain.

   ```curl
   curl -X DELETE \
     {base_url}/toolchains/{toolchain_id}/tools/{tool_integration_id} \
     -H 'Authorization: Bearer {token}'
   ```
   {: pre}
   {: curl}

   ```javascript
   const response = await toolchainService.deleteTool({
      toolchainId: {toolchain_id},
      toolId: {tool_integration_id}
   });
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: node}

   ```go
   deleteToolOptions := toolchainClient.NewDeleteToolOptions({toolchain_id}, {tool_integration_id})
   response, err := toolchainClient.DeleteTool(deleteToolOptions)
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: go}

   ```python
   response = toolchainService.delete_tool(
      toolchain_id = {toolchain_id},
      tool_id = {tool_integration_id}
   )
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: python}

   ```java
   DeleteToolOptions deleteToolOptions = new DeleteToolOptions.Builder()
      .toolchainId({toolchain_id})
      .toolId({tool_integration_id})
      .build();
   Response<Void> response = toolchainService.deleteTool(deleteToolOptions).execute();
   ```
   {: codeblock}
   {: java}

### Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration with Terraform
{: #insights-delete-integration-terraform}
{: terraform}

1. Locate the Terraform file (for example, `main.tf`) that contains the `resource` block for the existing {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   The `resource` blocks in the following example describe an existing toolchain and {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   ```terraform
   data "ibm_resource_group" "group" {
     name = "default"
   }

   resource "ibm_cd_toolchain" "cd_toolchain" {
     name              = "my toolchain"
     resource_group_id = data.ibm_resource_group.group.id
   }

   resource "ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_devopsinsights" "cd_toolchain_tool_insights" {
     toolchain_id = ibm_cd_toolchain.cd_toolchain.id
   }
   ```
   {: codeblock}

2. Remove the `resource "ibm_cd_toolchain_tool_devopsinsights"` block from your Terraform file.

3. Initialize the Terraform CLI.

   ```terraform
   terraform init
   ```
   {: pre}
   
4. Create a Terraform execution plan. This plan summarizes all of the actions that must run to delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   ```terraform
   terraform plan
   ```
   {: pre}

5. Apply the Terraform execution plan. Terraform takes all of the required actions to delete the {{site.data.keyword.DRA_short}} tool integration.

   ```terraform
   terraform apply
   ```
   {: pre}

For more information about using Terraform with {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}, see [Setting up Terraform for {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-terraform-setup).

# Configuring Sauce Labs
{: #saucelabs}

Sauce Labs runs functional unit tests. When a Sauce Labs test suite is configured as a test job in the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}}, the test suite can run tests against your web or mobile app as part of your continuous delivery process. These tests can provide valuable flow control for your projects, acting as gates to prevent the deployment of bad code.

This tool integration is available only on {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} Public.

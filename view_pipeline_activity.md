# Viewing your Delivery Pipeline activity
{: #viewing-data-overview}

The {{site.data.keyword.DRA_full}} Overview page automatically displays historical data from all of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}} within your toolchain for the US-south and EU-gb locations. You can view data about the last two weeks for stage failures, total time that is consumed by all stage runs, and the total number of jobs.

Viewing the status of your pipelines at a glance helps you to understand which jobs and stages are running into problems more often, and which runs are taking the longest time. You can troubleshoot and resolve issues with your pipelines to increase velocity for your deployments and better control of your processes.

   * Total time consumed: The total time that is used by all your stage runs.
   * Most frequently failing stages: A trend view of the top five most frequently failing stages to help you quickly identify the stages that are causing the most issues.

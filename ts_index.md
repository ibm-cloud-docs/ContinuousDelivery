## My {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service states that Lite plan services are deleted after 30 days of inactivity. What does inactivity mean?
{: #plan_inactivity}
{: faq}
{: support}

An instance of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service is considered active when one or more of the toolchains within the same resource group is active. A toolchain is considered active if users interact with it by way of the user interface, delivery pipeline jobs are triggered, or repositories that are managed by {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}} are accessed. To be considered inactive, all of these conditions must be absent for all of the toolchains that are associated with the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service, for 30 days.


## I tried to deploy an app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, why am I getting an error?
{: #org_outofmemory}
{: faq}

When trying to deploy an app to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}, if you get the following error message, the amount of memory that is remaining in your organization is less than the amount of memory that is required by the app that you want to deploy.

`FAILED Server error, status code: 400, error code: 100005, message: You have exceeded your organization's memory limit.`

You can either increase the memory quota of your account or reduce the memory that your apps use. The maximum memory quota for a trial account is 2 GB. To increase the memory quota of your account, convert your trial account to a pay account. For information about how to convert your trial account to a pay account, see [How do I upgrade or change my account?](/docs/account?topic=account-accountfaqs#changeacct). To reduce the memory that your apps use, use either the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console or the cf command line interface.

If you use the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console, complete the following steps:

1. In the Apps Dashboard, select your app. The app details page opens.
1. In the runtime pane, you can reduce the maximum memory limit or the numbers of app instances, or both, for your app.

If you use the cf command line interface, complete the following steps:

1. Check how much memory is being used for your apps. The cf apps command lists all the apps that you deployed in your current space. The status of each app is also displayed.

   ```text
   cf apps
   ```

1. To reduce the amount of memory that is used by your app, reduce the number of app instances or the maximum memory limit, or both:

   ```text
   cf push appname -p app_path -i instance_number -m memory_limit
   ```
    
1. Restart your app for the changes to take effect.


## Can I use sample scripts to build and deploy my application?
{: #sample_scripts}
{: faq}

The [open-toolchain/commons](https://github.com/open-toolchain/commons){: external} GitHub repo contains a collection of common scripts that you can use in toolchains and pipelines. For example, you can use one of the shell scripts that is contained in this repo within your own toolchains in various ways.


## How do I bring my own code and deploy it by using {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}
{: #bmoc_deploy}
{: faq}

You can choose any of the following options to deploy your own code to {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}:


* Go to the [Create App](https://cloud.ibm.com/developer/appservice/create-app?navMode=dashboard){: external} page, create your app, and then [enable {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}](/docs/apps/tutorials?topic=apps-tutorial-byoc) for the app. 
* Create a toolchain by using one of the available templates (dependent on the deployment target and tool integrations). On the **Create a Toolchain** page, select the appropriate provider for your source repository, and then specify the link to your source code repo. After you create your toolchain, you might need to adjust the pipeline scripts for your deployment goals.
* Create an empty toolchain, and then add tool integrations to deploy your app. For more information about using this method to deploy your code to {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}}, see [Continuous Deployment to Kubernetes](/docs/solution-tutorials?topic=solution-tutorials-continuous-deployment-to-kubernetes).

# Creating a Deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} button
{: #deploy-button}

The Deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} button is an efficient way to share your public Git-sourced app so that other people can experiment with the code and deploy it to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} by using a toolchain. The button requires minimal configuration and you can insert it anywhere that supports markup. Anyone who clicks the button creates a cloned copy of the code in a new Git repository (repo) so that your original app remains unaffected.
{: shortdesc}

When someone clicks your button, these actions occur:

1. If the person does not have an active {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account, they must create an account. They can create a trial account or a real account.

2. The person can select a region, resource group, and app name by clicking the {{site.data.keyword.deliverypipeline}} icon. The suggested app name is the same as the toolchain name, which is constructed from the name of your original Git repo and the time. The toolchain name can also be edited.

3. A toolchain is created that includes a new private clone of your Git repo, a pipeline for building and deploying code changes, and an issue tracker.

   If the `.bluemix` directory contains a `toolchain.yml` file, the file is used to specify the tool integrations for the toolchain. For more information about the `toolchain.yml` file, see [Creating custom toolchain templates](https://github.com/open-toolchain/sdk/wiki/Creating-Custom-Toolchain-Templates){: external}.
   {: tip}

4. If the app requires a build file, the build file is detected automatically and the app is built.

5. If a pipeline is configured for the build and deployment process, a `pipeline.yml` file is used to deploy the app.

6. If the app requires a container, a `pipeline.yml` file that defines the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}} and a Dockerfile that defines an image are used to deploy the app in the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}.

7. The app is deployed to the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} organization that the person selected.

## Examples of the button
{: #button-examples}

See an app button example for a public {{site.data.keyword.gitrepos}} repo:

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud button](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/Deploy_to_cloud.svg)](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://us-south.git.cloud.ibm.com/idsorg/sample-java-cloudant){: target="_blank"}

See an app button example for a public GitHub repo:

[![Deploy to IBM Cloud button](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/Deploy_to_cloud.svg)](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=https://github.com/open-toolchain/starfighter){: target="_blank"}

## Creating a button
{: #create-button}

To create a Deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} button, copy and modify one of the following snippet templates. Specify a Git repository and branch in the URL.

### Creating a button in HTML
{: #create-button-html}

To create a button in HTML, copy this snippet and insert a public Git repository URL and branch.

```HTML
<a href="https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=<git_repository_URL>&branch=<git_branch>"><img src="https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/Deploy_to_cloud.svg" alt="Deploy to IBM Cloud" target="_blank"></a>
```
{: codeblock}

If you don't include the `branch` parameter in your snippet's repository URL, the Deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} button defaults to the repository's master branch.

### Creating a button in Markdown
{: #Create-button-markdown}

To create a button in Markdown, copy this snippet and insert a public Git repository URL and branch.

```Markdown
[![Deploy to IBM Cloud button](https://cloud.ibm.com/media/docs/images/icons/Deploy_to_cloud.svg)](https://cloud.ibm.com/devops/setup/deploy?repository=<git_repository_URL>&branch=<git_branch>)
```
{: codeblock}

If you don't include the `branch` parameter in your snippet's repository URL, the Deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} button defaults to the repository's master branch.

### Using the button snippets
{: #button-snippet}

After you create a Deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} button snippet, you can insert it into blogs, articles, wikis, readme files, or anywhere else you want to promote your app.

When you customize the snippet for your Deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} button, consider that both of the templates use a default path to an external button image in SVG format and in English. If you prefer to store the image locally, you can download the image and store it in your Git repo. Adjust the path to use the relative location of the image.

## Repository considerations
{: #button-repo}

Review these considerations for the repo that you use in your Deploy to {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} button.


### Build file requirements
{: #build_file}

If the app must be built before it can be deployed, you must include a build file in your repo. If a build script file is detected in the root directory of the repo, an automated build of the code is triggered before deployment.

Supported builders include:

* [Ant:](http://ant.apache.org/manual/using.html){: external} `build.xml`, which builds output to the `./output/` folder
* [Gradle:](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/getting_started.html){: external} `/build.gradle`, which builds output to the `.` folder
* [Grunt:](http://gruntjs.com/getting-started#the-gruntfile){: external} `/Gruntfile.js`, which builds output to the `.` folder
* [Maven:](http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html){: external} `/pom.xml`, which builds output to the `./target/` folder

### Pipeline file requirements
{: #pipeline_file}

To configure the pipeline for the toolchain in a `.bluemix` directory, include a `pipeline.yml` file. For each `pipeline.yml` file in that directory, a pipeline is created when the toolchain is instantiated.

To create a pipeline file, consult the example file in the [Creating custom toolchain templates](https://github.com/open-toolchain/sdk/wiki/Creating-Custom-Toolchain-Templates){: external} documentation. Just as when you define a pipeline in the web interface, you define a pipeline in text by creating stages and jobs, setting inputs and environment variables, and adding scripts. You can also see a number of more complex pipeline files in [this demonstration project](https://github.com/open-toolchain/toolchain-demo/tree/master/.bluemix){: external}.

### Container Dockerfile requirements
{: #container_dockerfile}

To deploy an app in a container by using the {{site.data.keyword.containerlong_notm}}, you must include a Dockerfile in the root directory of the repo and, in a `.bluemix` directory, include a `pipeline.yml` file.

The Dockerfile acts as a kind of build script for the app. If a Dockerfile is detected in the repo, the app is automatically built into an image before it is deployed in a container. If the app itself must be built before the app is built into an image, include a build script for the app and a Dockerfile.

To learn more about creating Dockerfiles, see the [Docker documentation](https://docs.docker.com/reference/builder/){: external}. To follow step-by-step instructions using a toolchain template to deploy to Kubernetes, see [Tutorial: Use the "Develop a Kubernetes app" toolchain](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-toolchain?task=0){: external} or [Tutorial: Use the "Develop a Kubernetes app with Helm" toolchain](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/architecture/tutorials/use-develop-kubernetes-app-with-helm-toolchain?task=0){: external}.

To create a `pipeline.yml` manually that is specifically for containers, see the [examples in GitHub](https://github.com/Puquios/){: external}.

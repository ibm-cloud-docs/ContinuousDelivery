You must have an {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}} service instance before you can create and use toolchains that contain certain tool integrations. For more information about this limitation, see [Scope of a service instance](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-limitations_usage#service_scope).
{: shortdesc}

After you create a {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service instance by selecting it from the {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} catalog, you can [create continuous delivery toolchains](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-getting-started).

You can have one active instance of {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} only in a region and resource group. For information about deleting an existing service instance, see [Deleting a {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service instance](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-delete_cd_service).

1. Go to the [Resource list](https://cloud.ibm.com/resources){: external} for your {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} account.
1. In the **Services** section, locate the active {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service instance.
1. From the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service instance's **Actions** ![Overflow icon](images/overflow-icon-2.svg) menu, click **Delete**.
1. Click **Delete** to confirm that you want to delete the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service.

### Deleting a service instance by using the CLI
{: #deleting_rg_cli}
{: cli}

* To view service instances, run the [`ibmcloud resource service-instances`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_service_instances) command:

```text
~$ ibmcloud resource service-instances
``` 
{: codeblock}

### Restoring a deleted service instance
{: #restoring_cd_instance}

After you delete an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service, you can restore the deleted service instance within the data retention period of seven days. After the seven-day period expires, the service instance is permanently deleted. 

To view which service instances are available for restoration, use the [`ibmcloud resource reclamations`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_reclamations) command. To restore a deleted service, use the [`ibmcloud resource reclamation-restore`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_reclamation_restore) command. If you try to restore a deleted service and an active {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service instance exists, the restoration is blocked.

* Permanently remove the deleted service instance by using the [`ibmcloud resource reclamation-delete`](/docs/cli?topic=cli-ibmcloud_commands_resource#ibmcloud_resource_reclamation_delete) command, and then [create a {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_short}} service](/docs/ContinuousDelivery?topic=ContinuousDelivery-create_cd_service) instance again.

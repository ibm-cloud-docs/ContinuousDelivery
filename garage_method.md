# Continuous delivery practices
{: #gm_cd_best}



With {{site.data.keyword.contdelivery_full}}, you can build, test, and deliver applications by using DevOps practices and industry-leading tools. Continuous Delivery supports a wide variety of practices; but which practices should you use? There is no one-size-fits-all answer. The practices you employ can vary from one software delivery project to the next.  The [IBM&reg; Cloud Garage Method ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage){:new_window} is the IBM approach to rapidly deliver engaging applications. It combines continuous delivery with IBM Design Thinking, lean, DevOps, and agile practices. Those practices are focused on the cloud, but can benefit any software development effort.


## Adopting continuous delivery practices
{: #gm_cd_adopt}

To learn how to adopt a continuous delivery approach in your organization, use these Cloud Garage Method articles, tutorials and online courses, which are arranged from basic to advanced.

## Continuous delivery articles
{: #gm_cd_articles}

The Cloud Garage Method site contains articles that describe continuous delivery at a high level.

[Continuous Delivery ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/deliver/practice_continuous_delivery/] ){:new_window} is a practice by which you build and deploy your software so that it can be released into production at any time. One of the hallmarks of computer science is the shortening of various cycle times in the development and operations process.

With [Delivery Pipeline ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/deliver/tool_delivery_pipeline/){:new_window}, which is included in {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} Continuous Delivery, you can achieve continuous delivery in a consistent and reliable way by dividing the software delivery process into stages. The goal is for code to progress through each stage automatically with minimal human intervention.  With the [practice of using Delivery Pipelines] ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/garage/content/deliver/practice_delivery_pipeline/){:new_window}, you can automate the continuous deployment of your project.
